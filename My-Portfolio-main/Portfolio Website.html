  <h2>Welcome To My Portflio Website</h2><br>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mihlali, and this is my personal portfolio. Explore my skills, projects and professional journey. Feel free to reach   </p>

  <h3>Get To Know Me</h3><br>
 
  <p id="p1">
    I am a final year Information Systems and Finance student from the University of the Western Cape. I chose to immerse myself and pursue a career in the technology industry because of the interest and passion I have always had for technology, cybersecurity and digital innovation. From a young age i just thought hacking was cool and something i wanted to do, but as i grew older and pursued the career path I understood how broad the technology industry actualy is and the endless opportunities that lie ahead of me if i chose this career path. I have grown immensely and gained a lot of knowledge throughout my high school and tertiary years. I still have so much to learn as the world of tech is constantly changing rapidly daily and we have to adapt and keep ourselves informed about the changes and advancements. I am more than grateful to be a part of this journey. I am skilled in web development using various programming languages, data analysis, database management and administration, IoT... project management and business analysis.
