        <p>My background includes experience in programming, data analysis, software development, project management, and business analysis. As a member and organizer in the <strong>UWC IT Society</strong>, I have had the opportunity to plan events and connect with like-minded peers to foster tech engagement within my university campus. Additionally, my involvement with <strong>Women in Tech</strong> has been helpful in developing my leadership skills and advocating for inclusivity in technology.</p>
